# SuperHeroTask

I have Used Spring based framework that is Spring boot and spring MVC becouse of the follwoing reason.
1. I donot have to write all the boiler-plate configuration.I only have to write my bussiness logic to configure rest API.
2.Spring boot provide all the configulation for web mvc ,Spring Security and Spring test.
3.Spring boot has emebed tomcat server to easily test the code on application server.
4.Spring boot helps us to write Restful webservices with minimum line of code.
4.I have used mockito frame work along with some junit to test rest controller API and services becouse again i have to write few number code line and it provide easy stub and behavioral driven testing.

I have spent 2hr 45 minutes.
30 minute i spent in finding superheros power, allies and date of appearance.
